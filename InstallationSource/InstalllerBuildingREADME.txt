I built the installer using NSIS, a free scripting language for creating custom installers.

You need to install NSIS to compile the nsi files. but first you need to edit them for your enviroment.

Note these installers are setup for my laptop, therefore need editting before running on your computer.
All the source code is here, I woud recommend making a new custom installer for each build. 
NSIS is well documented and you need to download a complier for it. 

I have included more detailed instructions on the MPAi wiki.
